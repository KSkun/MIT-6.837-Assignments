![logo](images/7_logo.png)

Assigments of [MIT 6.837 *Intro to Computer Graphics* (2004 Fall)](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.837/F04/) by KSkun. The image above is one of the rendering results from Assignment 7.

- **Language:** C++

- **Rendering Method:** CPU Ray Tracing / OpenGL

**May exist bugs in previous assignments but fixed in later assignments.**

## Compile & Run

Each assignment project is placed in the folder named `AssignmentX`, with a corresponding `CMakeList.txt`. Please use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build, run and test them.

Test case files are stored in the `data` folder in each assignment project. You can test the assignments with these cases from the original course. Result files won't be uploaded, but some are showed as below.
